Take a page from the 20th century – a 10-week guide on how to bring back the adventure of summer.If you’re old enough to have kids, then you’re old enough to know a playlist is not a mixtape.

Sure, you’ll have to dig out your boom box from the basement and find some tapes. And you might have to tamp down on some analog-based whining from your kids, at least at the start. Tell them no one ever said kicking it old school wouldn’t require a little work.Besides, once they’ve got it right – and you know in your bones when it’s right, remember? – they’ll thank you.
