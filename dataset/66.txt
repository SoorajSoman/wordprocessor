Brian Follis has been charged with six counts of discreditable conduct, five counts of neglect of duty, two counts of deceit and one count each of insubordination and breach of confidence.Follis has been suspended from duty with pay.Since the allegations are not of a criminal nature, the case will be heard by a hearing officer at the Owen Sound police station on July 3.(CFOS)
