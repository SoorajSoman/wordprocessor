Justin Bieber is reportedly being investigated in connection with an alleged attempted robbery in the Los Angeles area.Police told KTLA Television that the pop star was not arrested, but was accused of attempted robbery after an incident late Monday in the San Fernando Valley.Sgt. Paul McLaughlin said police were initially called because Bieber had allegedly tried to take a girl’s phone.No other information about the incident was released by police.However, the TMZ website is reporting that an incident occurred at a batting cage where Bieber and some friends were hitting balls.The alleged victim told TMZ that Bieber and his friends got into a scuffle with other people at the park.When Bieber saw her reach for a phone to take pictures, the girl told TMZ that the pop star allegedly tried to grab it out of her hand.This latest brush with the law comes just days after it was decided that Bieber’s assault case in Toronto would be on hold until May 26.Police allege the Stratford, Ont., native hit a limousine driver in the back of the head after he and five others were picked up by a limo on Dec. 30.Bieber turned himself in to Toronto police in January to face the charge.In late April, a South Florida judge delayed Bieber’s trial on charges of driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license until July.Bieber’s lawyer requested the delay, saying more time was needed to examine evidence and make decisions about how to proceed.The 20-year-old singer was arrested Jan. 23 in Miami Beach after what police described as an illegal street drag race. He wasn’t charged with drag racing.
