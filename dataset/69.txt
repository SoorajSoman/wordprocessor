Francisco Alejandri is old enough to change the subject when asked his age but when he describes the punishment he endured on the journey to opening Toronto’s Agave y Aguacate, he’s as vulnerable as a child. Whether cooking at resorts in Mexico or in elite Toronto kitchens, Alejandri always garnered praise from above – and resentful jabs from below.Once, says Alejandri, the other guys made a big show of giving me a pair of new running shoes so I would run the hell away from them. The incident brought him to tears. Alejandri pressed on, and the Mexican food stall he later opened in Toronto’s Kensington Market became so popular it graduated to a restaurant in Baldwin village. After slogging at work, Alejandri knows the importance of blowing off steam. When friends come over, he turns down the lights, chooses some happy music and puts together a simple and elegant meal. This pinto-bean soup, as pared-down as the one his mother used to make, is a typical centrepiece to which he might add a salad, ceviche and, of course, several bottles of vino.
