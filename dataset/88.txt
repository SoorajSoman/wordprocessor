Has the dreaded melt-up arrived?A number of market watchers remain worried that ongoing central bank stimulus and investor risk-taking will send the stock market to unnatural heights as it diverges from underlying fundamentals.It’s the opposite of a meltdown – and at first glance, it doesn’t look like anything to be worried about. The prospect of rising stocks, after all, is the reason why most of us invest. But melt-ups have a downside: They tend to end in nasty crashes.Market strategists mulled the possibility of a melt-up last year when the S&P 500 shot above their year-end consensus target of 1,531 by mid-February. Since then, the index has risen another 422 points or nearly 28 per cent, bringing back the concerns.This bull market continues to charge ahead somewhat faster than I expected, said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, in a note.His year-end target for the S&P 500 is 2014, or less than 3 per cent away. He is maintaining the target, but noted there could be a melt-up between now and the end of the year.[We] were hoping that the internal correction over the past two months would reduce the likelihood of an irrational exuberance scenario for the market, he said, referring to the rotation out of expensive growth stocks and into cheaper value stocks. Now we are not so sure.Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America, believes that a melt-up is the key risk this summer – the product of high cash levels among investors, low trading volume, low market volatility, easy-money policies from central banks and lagging performance among institutional investors and hedge funds.Until central bank liquidity stops crushing volatility and the Fed is forced to tighten policy either due to a stronger economy or to curb Wall Street excesses, then excesses in credit and stock markets are more likely than not, Mr. Hartnett said in a note.But central banks are in no rush to reverse years of monetary policy stimulus.Indeed, the latest stock market surge followed a move last week by the European Central Bank to provide more stimulus: The ECB lowered a key interest rate below zero and said it could still resort other policy measures as it confronts the threat of deflation.The U.S. Federal Reserve is tapering its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, but has gone out of its way to assure investors that it will hold its key interest rate – now close to zero per cent – at very low levels for some time. Most observers don’t see a rate hike until 2015 at the earliest, even with the country’s unemployment rate falling faster than the central bank had expected.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, expects the Fed will lower its unemployment forecast next week, marking the sixth straight downward revision.This does not mean we expect any change in Fed policy in the near future, he said in a note. Tapering will continue at its current pace until the fall. What happens after that is contingent on an array of data, of which the inflation and wage numbers are the most important, assuming unemployment continues to decline as we expect.He believes the first rate hike will occur in the first quarter of 2015, but subsequent hikes could appear faster than policymakers and the market expect.Still, that leaves plenty of time for the stock market to keep rising.Most investors will no doubt like the ride higher, confident that they can get out at the first sign of danger.But as long-time bear John Hussman, of Hussman Funds, warns: A century of history strongly warns that whatever transitory gains the market achieves from present levels will be wiped out in spades, with little opportunity (particularly given thin trading volume) for more than a small set of investors to actually retain those gains over the completion of this cycle.
